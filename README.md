### Overview

An example of decently packaged Python code.

It installs data files and runs some extra install logic.

Note that the code itself, a package called addmult, is trivial. It's an example. Gimme a break. Jeez.

### Installation

This package can be installed by getting [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then in the terminal running:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dpinney/pythonPackagingExample
```

### Deploying to PyPI

To put this package on PyPI (enabling `pip install addmult`), use the deployToPypi.sh script.

Someone else might have put this up on PyPI with that name before you, so don't be mad if the script doesn't work.
